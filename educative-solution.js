/**
 * Solution #
Runtime complexity #
The runtime complexity if this solution is linear, O(n)O(n).

Memory complexity #
The memory complexity of this solution is constant, O(1)O(1).

We will keep two markers: read_index and write_index and point them to the end of the array. Letâ€™s take a look at an overview of the algorithm:

While moving read_index towards the start of the array:

If read_index points to 0, skip.
If read_index points to a non-zero value, write the value at read_index to write_index and decrement write_index.
Assign zeros to all the values before the write_index and to the current position of write_index as well.
